              <p>
                A cookie is a small encrypted text file sent by a website to
                your browser when you visit it. It may contain a mix of letters
                and numbers. Cookies help the website remember things about your
                visit and send information back to the website when you visit
                again. Additionally, it helps us enhance your experience,
                perform analytics, and provide relevant advertisements.

                We use different types of cookies to support the functionality,
                security, and performance of our service. Some cookies are
                essential to ensure the core features work properly, while

                  <strong>Essential (strictly necessary) cookies:</strong> We
                  use session cookies to manage your login session and keep you
                  authenticated while using our service. These are first-party
                  cookies that are essential for the secure operation of the

                  to protected areas of the website or app. Without these
                  cookies, certain features and secure areas may not function
                  properly.

                  effectiveness of our advertising efforts. This helps us
                  deliver more relevant ads, build custom audiences for
                  remarketing, and optimize user engagement based on behavior
                  analytics.
