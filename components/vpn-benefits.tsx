          The Benefits of Using a VPN

          Usually, your internet behavior stays exposed. You are always at the
          danger of hostile monitoring, privacy violation, and data theft while
          using the Internet, streaming material, or file sharing. A Virtual
          Private Network, or simply VPN, protects your internet connection,
          removes geo-restrictions, and keeps your activities totally private.
